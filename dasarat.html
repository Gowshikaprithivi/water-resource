<h1 align="center">A PARAGRAPH ON METHODS FOR WATER CONSERVATION</h1>

<p>Water is one of the basic necessities for every living being and we cannot imagine a life without water.

It is the natural resource and the main constituent of our planet earth.Water is the universal solvent and plays a key role in the existence of various forms of life on the planet earth.

It is widely used for various purposes such as washing, bathing, cleaning, cooking, drinking, and other industrial and domestic uses.

Water is a colourless and odourless substance that is essential for the survival of living beings.There are various sources of water such as wells, rivers, ponds, lakes, oceans, big dams, and streams.

As we all know,nearly 70 to 80 percent of the Earthâ€™s surface is covered by water,among which only 1-2 per cent water is pure and suitable for human use.</p>

<h2>Check your toilet for leaks:Put a few drops of food coloring in your toilet tank. If, without flushing,

the coloring begins to appear in the bowl., you have a leak that may be wasting more than 100 gallons of water a day.

<h3>Put a plastic bottle in your toilet tank:Put an inch or two of sand or pebbles in the bottom of a one liter bottle to weigh it down.

Fill the rest of the bottle with water and put it in your toilet tank, safely away from the operating mechanism.If your tank is big enough,

you may even be able to put in two bottles.In an average home, the bottle may save five gallons or more of water every day without harming the efficiency of the toilet.

<h4>Install water-saving shower heads or flow restrictors:Your hardware or plumbing supply store stocks inexpensive shower heads or flow restrictors that will cut your shower

flow to about three gallons a minute instead of five to ten.They are easy to install, and your showers will still be cleansing and refreshing.

<h1 align="center">A paragraph on factors for water pollution</h1>

<p>Water pollution is caused due to several reasons Sewage And Waste Water:Sewage, garbage and liquid waste of households, agricultural lands and factories

are discharged into lakes and rivers.These wastes contain harmful chemicals and toxins which make the water poisonous for aquatic animals and plants.

It is very important to prevent the polluting of water bodies and remove existing contaminants or reducing the concentration of these contaminants so as to make

it fit for desired use.Following are some of the ways of treating polluted water.

Septic tanks are used to treat sewage at the place of location instead of treating it in any plant or sewage system.

This system is used at the individual building level.The sewage is separated into solid and liquid components and treated separately.</p>

<h1 align="center">A brief explanation</h1>

<h2>Water pollution is caused due to several reasons. Here are the few major causes of water pollution:

<h3>Sewage And Waste Water: Sewage, garbage and liquid waste of households, agricultural lands and factories are discharged into lakes and rivers. These wastes contain harmful chemicals and toxins which make the water poisonous for aquatic animals and plants.

<h4>Dumping: Dumping of solid wastes and litters in water bodies causes huge problems. Litters include glass, plastic, aluminum, styrofoam etc. Different things take different amount of time to degrade in water. They affect aquatic plants and animals.

<h5>Industrial Waste: Industrial waste contains pollutants like asbestos, lead, mercury and petrochemicals which are extremely harmful to both people and environment. Industrial waste is discharged into lakes and rivers by using fresh water making the water contaminated.
